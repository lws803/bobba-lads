# PLANET_ZERO

## NASA SPACE APP CHALLENGE - 2019

Planets far and beyond -> Build a Planet

Repository (You can clone the swift api, build the project and play on your iphone!):

Swift: https://github.com/lws803/bobba-lads

Backend: https://github.com/teojunjie/nasa-server

Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x4tMuo3XZt...

Our team aims to educate children about space by making a highly interactive AR mobile app. With this app, users are able to spawn planetary objects on cards and have them interact with one another in the play space. Move the cards further away from each other and you will see the planet's orbit distance increase whilst slowing down its orbital rotation, vice versa. Users are also able to attach large varieties of compounds from our database on the planets and watch them change their states as you move them further away or closer to another planetary object.

With the power of ARKit, users can even make microscopic changes to the distances between planets by moving them slightly. (Try to find that goldilocks zone!)

In future, our team aims to include more planetary objects such as blackholes and add animation to the planets so users can watch how the surface of planets change as they move closer or further away from a sun! And users can really build a planet!

Challenges
It was our first time working on Swift and AR kit, so we had a lot of problems programming with swift
We also included some physics formula such as the gravitational force and inverse square law to calculate the orbit velocity and temperature, since our goal was to make an educational tool to demonstrate and simulate the formula. We were also short of time to prepare for a proper pitch, video and slides because we were focusing on the technical side of this project.
We tried to implement AR functionalities on both ios andandroid, but we failed to achieve that for android as there were some problems with ARcore and we do not have the time to fix and find out why.
